PREAMBLE

When I first saw this video come up in my YouTube recommendations,
I laughed about the assertiveness of the title paired with the murkiness
of the thumbnail. "Dont [sic] Bother Me". Who am I not bothering? I had
to know. I won't spoil it for you; here's the video.

POST_WATCH
Wasn't that just wonderful?

I love how it starts: a large, off-camera group of people is yelling
at some guy on a DDR set. The group seems pretty emphatic - is the
guy being bullied? Will he scream "Dont Bother Me"?

The guy shrugs. A nerdy voice says "let's see your new move!" in a tone
that screams sarcasm. The music starts.

The guy does a fucking handstand. What?!

The rest is history. Here's a random collection of stuff in this video
that brings me joy:
 - _SLAP, SLAP_. (0:45) Is that even a dance move? It's hilarious.

 - The bass comes through so nicely at the beginning and during
 the chorus, and he dances so perfectly on-beat.

 - How old is this guy?? Is he 15 or 22 or 30? Apparently his name
 is Smidget.

 - Where the hell is this place? Curtains surround the scene.
 The crowd seems huge, but they're behind the camera, which is
 already pretty far from the dance mats. Is it a DDR competition?
 (I don't want to know, it would ruin the mystery.) The incredibly
 low-quality camera helps, not hurts.

 - This has gotta be one of the first videos on all of YouTube.
 October 26, 2005.

 - His dancing is just excellent. He glides around the stage so
 smoothly. I can't see his DDR score, but I'm sure it's near-perfect.

 - The video's actual contents bring a new, funnier perspective on
 the "Dont Bother Me" title. [One YouTube commenter says:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crEz8i6oVpI&lc=UgzLuy58OdMF0FwXu_V4AaABAg)
 > I donâ€™t think we should bother him.



P.S.: Apparently Smidget
[performs again in 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1KUomqrfek),
now mostly bald but still full of spry moves. I think this newer video
perfectly contrasts with "Dont Bother Me" to show what I mean when I
say that I miss the early Internet. The newer video has no intrigue.
It's shot with a nicer camera, but the music just doesn't hit as hard.
Smidget is clearly older, a bit more tired - he makes a mistake
in the first twenty seconds. We can see his face - even _this_ we didn't
know from the first video. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to see him
all grown up and full of energy - but don't you see what I mean? The
old Internet is dead. It was dead even in 2014.
