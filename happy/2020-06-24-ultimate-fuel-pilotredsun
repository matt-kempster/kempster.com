PREAMBLE

My dreams often take place in desolate no-man's-lands.
Their lack of human presence is more peculiar than frightening -
a curiosity in a world all-too-full of people.
PilotRedSun's "Ultimate Fuel" welcomes this
dreamlike feeling of loneliness into waking life.
I'm a big PilotRedSun fan, but this video may be his best.

POST_WATCH
Things I love about this video:
 - At the very beginning, I like how the main character's car crashes
 into (what I can only assume is) the gas station owner's. The crash just
 incinerates the rear of the car linearly.

 - The way our guy gesticulates is hilarious. [One YouTube comment puts it best:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FDNQWnLx6g&lc=UgwDzmZo37H6tYWK8kZ4AaABAg)
 > “You don’t have the new state of the art bio diesel they’ve been rollin out?” ✊🤟👆👆🖐🖐🖕🤚🖖🤙👋👈👉👈👉🤜

 - When our guy dangles his state-of-the-art keyfob in front of
 the cashier, the screen hopelessly bends and contorts. The way
 this is done is a hilarious parody of similar scenes from TV/film.
 It's also pretty intimidating.

 - _Sauthern Cuts._ Also, KЯoRꓘ.

 - The way the deep fryer's oil bobs delicately in perfectly smooth
 bumps as the cashier's hat disintegrates.

 - The guy's face at the end as he looks up. Delightfully stupid.

 - Not to sound like a broken record, but this video really is
 dreamlike. I especially like the sky's dreary orange color
 present in almost every scene... it's pretty.
